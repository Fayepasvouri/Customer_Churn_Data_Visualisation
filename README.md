# Customer_Churn_Data_Visualisation

This is the coding part of my MSc thesis for the Master in Makreting Management and Analytics (Southampton University)

The data have been collected online (primary data collection) using a survey builder tool. 

The results have been categorised into three sub-groups:

1) Customer churn results of EU applicants in the UK universities post Brexit period

2) Geographical data visualisations as a result of participants' countries of origin

3) Sentiment analysis of the last open-ended question (textual data)
